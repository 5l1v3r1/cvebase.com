BleedingTooth is a Bluetooth Zero-Click Remote Code Execution existing in the Linux kernel that could be exploited by attackers to run arbitrary code or access sensitive information. A remote attacker within the Bluetooth range of the victim can exploit the flaw by knowing the bd address of the target device. The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malicious l2cap packet, which can lead to denial of service or even execution of arbitrary code, with kernel privileges.
